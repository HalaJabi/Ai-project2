Linear Binary Classifier: This project is a linear binary classifier that uses the perceptron learning algorithm. The program has a GUI that allows the user to enter data points, set the learning rate and maximum number of iterations, and see the system performance. The GUI also has a graph that shows the classification region (line) after training. The user can also enter out-of-sample data to test the classifier.
